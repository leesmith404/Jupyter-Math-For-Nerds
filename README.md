# Jupyter-Math-For-Nerds
## Quick reference for using Sympy and Jupyter to quickly solve college math problems.

### Amazingly SOME Computer Science students do not like MATH ?!?!

### Amazingly SOME Math students do not like COMPUTER SCIENCE ?!?!

#### I have created a number of very simple Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate College Math solutions:
 - Algebra
 - Analytic Geometry
 - Trigonometry
 - Plotting
 - Differative
 - Calculus
 - Series and Limits
 - Linear Analysis [coming soon]
 - ODE and PDE [differential equations] are a work in progress
 
 ####  If you do not have Anaconda installed on your computer [See How-To-Use.md]
 #### you can find an PDF version of each Jupyter Notebook file.
 ### Jupiter-Files FOLDER has the Jupyter Notebook files [.ipynb extension]
 
 ##### ENJOY -- LeeSmithSBCC@gmail.com 
  - I will post some of the responses and questions.
